# Analysis of EEG data for imagined speech task

## Summary
Some of the task which will be performed are listed below
- Classification: Recognising units of speech from recorded EEG signals.
- Brain mapping: EEG signals are obtained from different electrodes placed on the surface of the scalp. Identifying the region of the brain based on electrical activity in EEG signals.
- Reconstruction: After performing the tasks of classification and localisation, the reconstruction task is to generate sound from syllables or phonemes present in the EEG signal.

## Codes
